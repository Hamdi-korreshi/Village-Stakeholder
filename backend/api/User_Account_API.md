## Some information about the API
Frontend
    - **Make sure to include the session tokens when using sending API calls**

Basic Terminology
    - Post -> used to send data to the API, think of User Registration, also the backend team needs to check for duplications since it can create duplicates.
    - Get -> used to fetch data from the API, think of getting a User profile.
    - Put -> used to update records in an existing source, think of updating user profile.
    - Patch -> Similar to put but only updates a part of the record, think of updating the user profile but only with one part.
    - Delete -> Removes a record completely, self explanatory.
